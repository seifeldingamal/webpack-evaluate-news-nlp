# Project Instructions

This repo is your starter code for the project. It is the same as the starter code we began with in lesson 2. Install and configure Webpack just as we did in the course. Feel free to refer to the course repo as you build this one, and remember to make frequent commits and to create and merge branches as necessary!

The goal of this project is to give me practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

The base project uses an NLP API to evaluate entered text. NLPs leverage machine learning and deep learning create a program that can interpret natural human speech. Systems like Alexa, Google Assistant, and many voice interaction programs are well known to us, but understanding human speech is an incredibly difficult task and requires a lot of resources to achieve. Full disclosure, this is the Wikipedia definition, but I found it to be a clear one:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

You could spend years and get a masters degree focusing on the details of creating NLP systems and algorithms. Typically, NLP programs require far more resources than individuals have access to, but a fairly new API called Aylien has put a public facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in this project to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.

## Getting started

Remember to use the following lines inorder to get the project dependencies installed:

- `npm install` || `yarn install`

To start the project in production state:

- `npm run build-prod`
- `npm start`

## API Details

The MeaningCloud API was pretty easy to get ready for using.

### Step 1: Signup for an API key
### Step 2: Environment Variables

### Step 5: Using the API

We're ready to go! The API has a lot of different endpoints you can take a look at [here](https://learn.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis/2.1/doc/request).
